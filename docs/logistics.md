## Lodging

There are many hotels ranging in price and quality in downtown Berkeley that are close to the venue.  If you are interested in staying at the [Berkeley guest house](http://www.berkeleylabguesthouse.org/), please contact Ben Nachman (there are rooms available and it is $145/night).  This is at LBNL, so a 15 min walk from BIDS or a similar-length shuttle ride.  It has a great view, but is not convenient for experiencing downtown Berkeley.

## Travel
#### Subway
BIDS is a 10 minute walk from the downtown Berkeley BART stop.
