## Rationale

The aim of this meeting is to gather researchers from across the Bay Area
interested in Likelihood-Free Inference and Density Estimation for the Physical Sciences. This small-scale meeting will provide a forum to exchange problems, ideas, and techniques while leaving plenty of time for discussion and collaboration/hacking. Among the topics we would like to cover are techniques for likelihood-free and simulation-based inference, active learning/sampling, density estimation, uncertainty quantification and any applications of these techniques to problems in the physical sciences.

Registration is free but we ask you to **register before Wednesday, November 27th** at [this link](registration.html).

We aim to make this meeting a collaborative and productive event, and in that spirit we invite
participants to propose topics for discussion, hacks, or tutorials by clicking this button:
